    <li>Svelte</li>
    <li>TypeScript (config files are in JavaScript for some reason I do not remember)</li>
    <li>TailwindCSS/Flowbite (like Chakra UI but for Svelte)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Aditional notes</h4>
<p>
    Used html native elements for the main part and went migrating some of them, like input fields and the select field, to Flowbite components for better UX. 
    <br></br>
    I opted for Flowbite because I'm new to Svelte, this is my first Svelte project, and wanted to simplify the styling process but get a more consisten 'professional' feel while I was at it.
